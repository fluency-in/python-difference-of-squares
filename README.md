# Python: Difference Of Squares

Find the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sums of the first N natural numbers.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

    1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385

Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first
ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares is 2640:

    3025 - 385 = 2640

To run a test file, pass it as an argument to the `python` command:

    python hello_world_test.py

If you want to stop the tests after the first failure, then you can use the pytest library.

Install pytest with pip:

    pip install pytest

Run the tests with the `py.test` command using the `-x` flag to exit after the first failure.

    py.test -x hello_world_test.py
